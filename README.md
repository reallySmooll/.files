# dotfiles
My dotfiles.

## Usage
**NOTE: It's recommended that you install your Arch system using `archinstall`.**

Usage is pretty easy, you just select the script with the prefix `setup-` and run it.

If the script doesn't start try:

```bash
$ chmod +x ./setup-*.sh
```

This should make the scripts executable, and you'll be able to run them.

If there's some other error, then sorry, but I can't help you. I haven't tested these scripts yet.
